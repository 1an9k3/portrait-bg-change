# Portrait Bg Change
It's a end-to-end deep learning solution for person who wants to change background color in a particular photo.

I do it just for exercise my skill, not for commercial usage.

A very frequent use scenario is to change the background color of protrait photos and use one of them as an attachment of their resume, apply sheet and so on.

For the propose to make a out-of-the-box solution, I developed its FE, BE as well as DS(Algorthom) Sections and combined them to a integral web app.

## Technical Solution
+ Algorithm: ``Modnet``(see: https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet)
+ BE Framework: ``mosec``(see: https://mosecorg.github.io/mosec/) 
+ FE: ``Bootstrap``(see: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
